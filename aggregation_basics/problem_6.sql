/* 🟥 Problem 6 - Aggregation
❓Question:
Using the job_postings_fact table find the average, minimum, and maximum salary range for each job_title_short. Only include job titles with more than 1,000 job postings and group data by job_title_short . Order by job_title_short in ascending order.

🔎 Hint:
To get jobs with more than 5 postings this requires filtering on an aggregate function since you need to count job postings, use HAVING.
