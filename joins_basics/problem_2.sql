/* üü® Problem 2 - JOINs
‚ùìQuestion:
Fetch all job postings, including their job_id, job_title and the names of the skills required (skills); even if no skills are listed for a job. 
Ensure that the job is located in ‚ÄòNew York‚Äô and offers health insurance. 
Use the job_postings_fact, skills_job_dim, and skills_dim tables. 
Order by job_id in descending order.
üîé Hint:
Think about what JOIN you want to use for ‚Äúeven if no skills are listed for a job‚Äù.
You‚Äôll need to JOIN 2 tables to the job_postings_fact table. skills_job_dim to match the skills with the job and then skills_dim to get the skill name.
In the WHERE clause look at job_location to filter specific job locations and job_health_insurance to see if the company offers health insurance.
