/* 
üü® Problem 2 - CASE Statements
‚ùìQuestion:
Count the number of unique companies that offer work from home (WFH) versus those requiring work to be on-site. Use the job_postings_fact table to count and compare the distinct companies based on their WFH policy (job_work_from_home).

üîé Hint:

Use COUNT with DISTINCT to find unique values.
CASE WHEN statements to separate companies based on their WFH policy.
The data will be from the job_postings_fact table
*/

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN job_work_from_home = TRUE THEN company_id END) AS wfh_companies_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN job_work_from_home = FALSE THEN company_id END) AS on_site_companies_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact;

    /*
    üí°Solution:

In SELECT use COUNT(DISTINCT ...) to calculate the unique companies.
CASE WHEN to check the job_work_from_home flag.
Count as WFH if job_work_from_home is TRUE.
Count as non-WFH if job_work_from_home is FALSE.
The data is coming FROM the job_postings_fact table.
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN job_work_from_home = TRUE THEN company_id END) AS wfh_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN job_work_from_home = FALSE THEN company_id END) AS non_wfh_companies
FROM job_postings_fact;
