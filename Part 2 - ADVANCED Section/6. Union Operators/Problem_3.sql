/*  üü• Problem 3 - UNION Operators
‚ùìQuestion:
Analyze the monthly demand for skills by counting the number of job postings for each skill in the first quarter (January to March), utilizing data from separate tables for each month. Ensure to include skills from all job postings across these months. The tables for the first quarter job postings were created in the Advanced Section - Practice Problem 6 [include timestamp of Youtube video].

üîé Hints:

Use UNION ALL to combine job postings from January, February, and March into a consolidated dataset.
Apply the EXTRACT function to obtain the year and month from job posting dates, even though the month will be implicitly known from the source table.
Group the combined results by skill to summarize the total postings for each skill across the first quarter.
Join with the skills dimension table to match skill IDs with skill names.

üí°Solution:

Create a CTE named combined_job_postings to consolidate job postings from the first quarter:
Include job postings from january_jobs, february_jobs, and march_jobs using UNION ALL to ensure all data from these months are combined.
Select job_id and job_posted_date from each month's table, making sure that all postings are captured, including duplicates.
Create a second CTE called monthly_skill_demand to calculate the demand for skills month by month:
In the SELECT statement:
skills to get the skill
Use EXTRACT to pull out the year (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM combined_job_postings.job_posted_date)) and month (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM combined_job_postings.job_posted_date))
COUNT the number of job postings for each skill (COUNT(combined_job_postings.job_id))
Get data FROM the combined_job_postings CTE.
INNER JOIN the combined_job_postings with skills_job_dim on job_id to associate job postings with their required skills.
INNER JOIN the skills_dim on skill_id to get the names and types of the skills.
GROUP BY the skills, year, month
In main query:
Get the skills, year, month, and postings_count
FROM the monthly_skill_demand CTE
Use ORDER BY to sort the results first by skill name (skills), then year, and month
