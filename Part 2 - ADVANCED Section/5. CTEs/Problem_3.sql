/* üü• Problem 3 - CTEs
‚ùìQuestion:

Calculate the number of unique skills required by each company. Aim to quantify the unique skills required per company and identify which of these companies offer the highest average salary for positions necessitating at least one skill. For entities without skill-related job postings, list it as a zero skill requirement and a null salary. Use CTEs to separately assess the unique skill count and the maximum average salary offered by these companies.

üîé Hints:
Use two CTEs.
The first should focus on counting the unique skills required by each company.
The second CTE should aim to find the highest average salary offered by these companies.
Ensure the final output includes companies without skill-related job postings. This involves use of LEFT JOINs to maintain companies in the result set even if they don't match criteria in the subsequent CTEs.
After creating the CTEs, the main query joins the company dimension table with the results of both CTEs.

üí°Solution:

Start with a CTE named required_skills
Count the distinct skills (COUNT(DISTINCT skills_to_job.skill_id)) required by each company (company_id).
Then LEFT JOIN the company_dim with job_postings_fact and skills_job_dim tables, ensuring even companies with no skills-related job postings are included.
GROUP BY the company_id

Create a second CTE called max_salary
Get the highest average yearly salary (MAX(job_postings.salary_year_avg)) offered by companies (company_id)
Only get jobs that require at least one skill by filtering out job postings that have an associated skill in the skills_job_dim table (job_postings.job_id IN (SELECT job_id FROM skills_job_dim))
GROUP BY the company_id
In the main query
SELECT the company names (name) from the company_dim table, unique_skills_required from required_skills CTE, and highest_average_salary from the max_salary CTE
Get information FROM the company_dim table.
LEFT JOIN the company_dim table with the required_skills CTE to bring in the count of unique skills required by each company.
LEFT JOIN the company_dim table with the max_salary CTE to include the highest average salary offered by these companies.
ORDER BY the company names in ascending order.
