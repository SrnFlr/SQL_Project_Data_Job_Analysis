/* 🟨 Problem 5 - Aggregation
❓Question:
In the job_postings_fact table, determine the average yearly salaries (salary_year_avg) for ‘Data Scientist’ job postings, using the job_title_short column. Your query should return one column for the average yearly salary. Only include jobs that have a yearly salary (salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL).

🔎 Hint:
Only include job postings where a yearly salary is specified (WHERE salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL).
NOTE: If you’re following along in the video, we’ll cover IS NOT NULL here shortly

SELECT
	AVG(salary_year_avg) AS avg_yearly_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE 
	salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist';
